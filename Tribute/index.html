            <p>Tesla was born in Smiljan, Croatia, on July 10, 1856.

Tesla was one of five children, including siblings Dane, Angelina, Milka and Marica. Tesla's interest in electrical invention was spurred by his mother, Djuka Mandic, who invented small household appliances in her spare time while her son was growing up.

Tesla's father, Milutin Tesla, was a Serbian orthodox priest and a writer, and he pushed for his son to join the priesthood. But Nikola's interests lay squarely in the sciences.

              It was while in Budapest that the idea for the induction motor first came to Tesla, but after several years of trying to gain interest in his invention, at age 28 Tesla decided to leave Europe for America.

            <p>In 1884 Tesla arrived in the United States with little more than the clothes on his back and a letter of introduction to famed inventor and business mogul Thomas Edison, whose DC-based electrical works were fast becoming the standard in the country.

Edison hired Tesla, and the two men were soon working tirelessly alongside each other, making improvements to Edison's inventions.

Several months later, the two parted ways due to a conflicting business-scientific relationship, attributed by historians to their incredibly different personalities: While Edison was a power figure who focused on marketing and financial success, Tesla was commercially out-of-touch and somewhat vulnerable.
        
        <p>Here's a short funny video of what Tesla and Edison had looked if they could rap.

<h2 class="modal__heading">Remote Control</h2>
<p class="modal__paragraph">
 In Madison Square Garden, at the Electrical Exhibition of 1898, Tesla staged a scientific tour de force, a demonstration completely beyond the generally accepted limits of technology. His invention, covered in patent No. 613,809 (1898), took the form of a radio-controlled boat, a heavy, low-lying, steel craft about four feet long. Inasmuch as radio hadn't been officially patented yet (Tesla's basic radio patent was filed in September 1897, but granted in March 1900), examiners from the US Patent Office were reluctant to recognize improbable claims made in the application "Method of and Apparatus for Controlling Mechanism of Moving Vessels or Vehicles." Confronted with a working model, however, examiners quickly issued approval.
 In fact, Tesla had been walking around New York City since 1895 picking up radio signals generated in various high-frequency experiments; he had received them as far as thirty miles away, at West Point. With the invention or improvement of several more control elements, he was able in short time to put them to use.

<h2 class="modal__heading">Electric Motor</h2>
<p class="modal__paragraph">
Tesla designed the alternating-current (AC) electrical system, 
 which would quickly become the preeminent power system of the 20th
 century and has remained the worldwide standard ever since. He then invented the induction motor with rotating magnetic field that made unit drives for machines feasible and made AC power transmission an economic necessity.
In 1887 and 1888 Tesla had an experimental shop at 89 Liberty Street, New York, and there he invented the induction motor. He sold the invention to Westinghouse in July 1888 and spent a year in Pittsburgh instructing Westinghouse engineers.

<h2 class="modal__heading">Tesla coil</h2>
<p class="modal__paragraph">
 In the late 19th century, Tesla patented the Tesla coil, which laid the foundation for wireless technologies and is still used in radio technology today.
 The heart of an electrical circuit, the Tesla coil is an inductor used in many early radio transmission antennas.It is a high-frequency transformer capable of creating very high voltage at low current. He built several variations of his invention.
The most popular of his designs is made up of a transformer, capacitor, spark gap, main coil, minor coil and discharge sphere.

<h2 class="modal__heading">Wireless Communication</h2>
<p class="modal__paragraph">
In 1901 Tesla began his work of a large high-voltage wireless energy transmission station called the Wardenclyffe Tower. Small-scale wireless power transfer as a prototype transmitter for a “World Wireless System” that was to broadcast both information and power worldwide was demonstrated to investors, nut they had pulled out and the facility was never completed. Although Tesla stated his ideas were proven, he had a history of failing to confirm his ideas by experiment,
but it seems like he had no evidence that he ever transmitted meaningful power beyond the short-range demonstrations above.

  <h2>Nikola Tesla’s Failures, Death </h2>
  <hr style="border:1px dotted #f0f0f0">
        
      <p>In 1895 Tesla’s New York lab burned, destroying years’ worth of notes and equipment. Tesla relocated to Colorado Springs for two years, returning to New York in 1900. He secured backing from financier J.P. Morgan and began building a global communications network centered on a giant tower at Wardenclyffe, on Long Island. But funds ran out and Morgan balked at Tesla’s grandiose schemes.
       Tesla lived his last decades in a New York hotel, working on new inventions even as his energy and mental health faded. His obsession with the number three and fastidious washing were dismissed as the eccentricities of genius. He spent his final years feeding—and, he claimed, communicating with—the city’s pigeons.
       Tesla died in his room on January 7, 1943. Later that year the U.S. Supreme Court voided four of Marconi’s key patents, belatedly acknowledging Tesla’s innovations in radio. The AC system he championed and improved remains the global standard for power transmission
